Welcome to Lambda Lost! I’m so happy you’re here. I’m Ash, a girl who codes.

I want to inspire other girls to enter the computer science field and enjoy the opportunities it offers. I enrolled in Lambda School’s data science program in January 2021, ready to jumpstart my career in coding. It can be overwhelming in the beginning, I’ve often felt lost myself, so we’ve got to help eachother out! I’ll be sharing my projects from the course and on the side, interesting data and computer science applications, and other things along the way! Follow along as I start this journey into the land of code with no prior experience, just a desire to learn something new!

XOXO, Ash
